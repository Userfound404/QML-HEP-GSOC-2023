        "### What is quantum computing?\n",
        "\n",
        "A classical computer at it's smallest level contains transistors to implement all the processes. The transistors can be seen as a switch that either lets the bits flow or not.\n",
        "\n",
        "**What are bits?**\n",
        "\n",
        "The bit is the most basic unit of information in computing and digital communications. It can be either a 1 or 0.\n",
        "But as the size of transistors size is decreasing, where we currently have 7nm fabrication but going below that size might make the transistors not in the intended way. The electrons would directly jump through *quantum tunneling*\n",
        "\n",
        "Using this to our advantages, In a quantum computer we use qubits, instead of bits. where each qubit can hold a different value of 0 and 1 in the same qubit at once.\n",
        "This is known as superposition. The qubit can hold one of two values, It can be any two level quantum system such as a spin or magnetic field. A qubit is in a superposition of probabilities for 0 or 1 but as soon as we measure it, it collapses into either 1 or 0.\n",
        "\n",
        "This is where a quantum computer shines. 4 classical bits can store 2^4 values at a time out of which we can use one while 4 qubits can stay in all 2^4 states at once. This grows exponentially just as we add an extra qubit.\n",
        "just 20 qubits can store upto a million values parallely. 2^20 = 1,048,576 values.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Quantum Entanglement**\n",
        "\n",
        "*Quantum entanglement is a phenomenon in quantum mechanics where two or more particles can become correlated in such a way that the state of one particle is dependent on the state of the other particle, regardless of the distance between them. This means that if you measure the state of one particle, the state of the other particle is instantaneously determined, even if it is on the other side of the universe.*\n",
        "This means that we can measure all the states by not even looking at all the other qubits.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Quantum Gate**\n",
        "\n",
        "It manupulates an input of superpositions, rotates probabilities and produces an output.\n",
        "There are various kinds of gates like:\n",
        "1. Hadamard Gate(H-gate) - puts a qubit into a superposition, with equal probabilities of being in the state 0 and 1.\n",
        "        1/√2 [[1 1]\n",
        "            [1 -1]]\n",
        "2. Pauli (X gate) - similar to a classical NOT gate. it just flips from |0> to |1> \n",

        "       [[1 0]\n",
        "       [0 -1]]\n",
        "3. CNOT gate-  two-qubit gate that performs a conditional operation on the second qubit based on the state of the first qubit.\n",
